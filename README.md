# Introduction

Firestore is [launched](https://firebase.googleblog.com/2017/10/introducing-cloud-firestore.html) in early October 2017 to the public as a beta release. 

Google has been [recommending](https://firebase.googleblog.com/2017/10/cloud-firestore-for-rtdb-developers.html) "most new applications start with Cloud Firestore". 

However, as a developer goes through the [docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/), you may notice there are some caveats.  

This page serves as a one-stop center to know about the things / "caveats" to consider before really adopting Cloud Firestore in an app. 

Even though Firestore addresses a number of shortcomings in the Realtime Database, it is important to note that it is not a magic silver bullet.
